> Building cloud-native platforms that developers love to use 🌩️

👈 Yes, that really is a *giant* Pac-Man cup; no, it's not because I've got a tiny head (or maybe it is?)

## 👋 About Me

I didn’t start with much. But I started with a C64, a mind full of questions, and a lot of time alone.

That turned into BASIC, games, C/C++, and reverse engineering. Curiosity gave me a future.

I’m Lee, co-founder and CTO at Cloudsmith. I’ve gone from bedroom coding in Belfast to building a platform that helps secure the software supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world.

I helped build Newzbin and Cloudsmith. I’ve worked across search, cloud, security, and developer tools. I’ve lived through failure, burnout, heartache, fundraising, rebuilds, breakthroughs, and success.

I still stay close to the code. I obsess over good architecture, smart defaults, and making engineers' lives easier. It doesn’t need to be magic; it just needs to be honest, reliable, and built right.

If you care about platform engineering, developer experience, critical infrastructure, securing the world’s software, or scaling without breaking the team, let’s talk. Starting something new? I’d love to hear about it.
