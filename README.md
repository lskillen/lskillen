Chief Code Monkey at [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com), Father of Two, and All-Round Technology Geek.

üëà Yes, that really is a *giant* Pac-Man cup; no, it's not because I've got a tiny head (or maybe it is?)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ 3-Time Founder:

1. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è [**Newzbin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newzbin) (2001-2010) - It changed the world (well, some part of it) and got shut down by the MPAA. :'(
2. üî® [**Vulcan FT**](https://github.com/vulcanft) (2012-2016) - It did not change the world, but it was a fantastic learning experience; it ran out of cash. :(
3. üå©Ô∏è [**Cloudsmith**](https://cloudsmith.com) (1.0: 2016-2018, 2.0: 2018-) - A cloud-native artifact management 24/7 SaaS. Working on changing the world. ;)

### üÜé Some things about me:

- I'm an experienced technical leader and engineer passionate about building, naming, and caching things.
- I love working in the developer tools domain, which is "by developers, for developers"; where better to work than with and for developers?
- My strengths involve a flair for precise detail and the capability to operate at different levels, from a deep dive into the specifics of software/hardware and web-scale architecture to managing a business or leading teams of excellent engineers to communicating with customers, executives, and the office problem bear.
- I'm friendly, considerate, and open to sharing hard-won business insights and technical experiences with the world.
- I contribute to open-source projects where possible (and I'd like to do more) and offer my services pro bono/gratis to help others.
- I'm also a self-certified gadget, gaming (video games, board games, social games, you name it!), and general technology geek.
- I occasionally balance all that with exploring the outside world, usually with two of the best munchkins I ever invented (they're now aged 10+13 and rapidly catching up in height).

### ‚ùì What's going on?

Having raised over $30 million (ü§ë), we are building the team and technology of Cloudsmith through to IPO (üöÄ).

WE ARE HIRING. See: https://careers.cloudsmith.com/
