## About ~Lee~ Me

Chief Code Monkey at [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com), Father of Two, and All-Round Technology Geek.

3-Time Founder:

1. Newzbin - It changed the world (well, some part of it) and got shut down by the MPAA. :'(
2. Vulcan FT - It did not change the world, but it was a fantastic learning experience; it ran out of cash. :(
3. Cloudsmith - A cloud-native artifact management 24/7 SaaS. Working on changing the world. ;)

Some things about me:

- I'm an experienced technical leader and engineer passionate about building, naming, and caching things.
- I love working in the developer tools domain, of "by developers, for developers".
- My strengths involve a flair for precise detail and the capability to operate at different levels, from a deep dive into the specifics of software/hardware and web-scale architecture to managing a business or leading teams of excellent engineers to communicating with customers, executives, and the office problem bear.
- I'm friendly, considerate, and open to sharing hard-won business insights and technical experiences with the world.
- I contribute to open-source projects where possible (and I'd like to do more) and offer my services pro bono/gratis to help others.
- I'm also a self-certified gadget, gaming, and technology geek who occasionally balances that with exploring the outside world, usually with two of the best munchkins I ever invented (they're now aged 10+13 and rapidly catching up in height).

Having raised over $30 million, we are building the team and technology of Cloudsmith through to IPO.

WE ARE HIRING. See: https://cloudsmith.com/careers/
